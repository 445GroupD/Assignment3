Election Process
1) Follower stops receving heartbeats and times out
2) Follower becomes a candidate, increments its term number, and restarts its election timeout counter
3) New Candidate votes for itself and sends out RequestVote packets
4) Candidate waits for votes
  a) Receives a valid vote packet
    - increments vote count
  b) Receives a majority
    - claims itself as leader and starts sending out heartbeats
  c) Receives a Heartbeat or RequestVote packet from a server with a term >= current term
    - returns to follower state
  d) Election Timeout occurs
    - restart election process
    
Follower receives a RequestVote packet
1) Check term number of packet
  a) RequestVote packet's term number <= current term 
    - ignore packet
  b) RequestVote packet's term number > current term
    - send a Vote packet
    - set current term = term number of RequestVote packet
2) Waits for heartbeats
  a) Term Number of Heartbeat >= current term
    - update current term
    - update leader id
  b) Term Number of Heartbeat < current term
    - ignore heartbeat
